â€¢	Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
I worked as an AI developer for a gaming company on this project. I have been asked to design an intelligent agent of the game for a non-player character to represent the pirate. The pirate must navigate the game world, which consists of different pathways and obstacles, to find the treasure.
I have been provided two pythons files GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py, as long as a Jupiter notebook file TreasureHuntGame.ipynb. I had only to implement the deep Q-learning algorithm.
o	What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve problems using technology. They write and program software, create applications for mobile devices, and develop websites. Their primary objectives are to validate and develop mathematical models capable of computer interaction between people and other computers. In this class, we develop, implement and analyze machine learning algorithms.
o	How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist and problem solver, I must approach a problem by understanding it, designing a solution, implementing the solution, and checking it.
o	What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities are to comply with the regulations, standards, and policies.
